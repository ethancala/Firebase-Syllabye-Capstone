    academicInfoStudents: `Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more information about academic support services, visit the website at: www.lewisu.edu/CASE.

    academicIntegrity: `Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion, and other forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level. Appeal of the department/program decision must be made to the Dean of the college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases, the Provost makes the final decision.`.replace(/\s+/g, " ").trim(),
